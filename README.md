## Introduction

The ASC CSE IoT 2.0 board is the second in the series of boards released by Amrita School of Computing, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore.
It is an all in one kit to get you started on embedded systems development.

### About the Board

The ASC CSE IoT 2.0 comes with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is based on the Espressif ESP32-WROOM Series.
It can be connected to a PC via a USB Type - C connector for power, programming and serial communication.
The board also contains
- 2 Programmable LEDs
- 1 LDR
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 Programmable Switch

The board has custom made connectors for various commonly used sensors and modules:
- 3-Axis Gyroscope and AccelerometerMPU6050
- CAN Transceiver TJA105
- USB2UART FT232 Module
- 8 MB SPI based Data Flash module W25Q64

This enables simple plug-and-play use.

Other modules using the same protocols will need to be connected to these interfaces using jumper wires if their pinouts don't match the connectors on the board.

## Getting Started

To begin learning about the ASC CSE IoT 2.0 (ESP32) complete the setup by refering to the [setup-docs](SETUP.md). Post setup, head over to the [`basics/blink`](basics/blink) directory to get started.
