## Introduction

![The ASC CSE IoT 2.0](assets/asc-iot-2.0-esp32-topview.jpg)

The ASC CSE IoT 2.0 board is the second in the series of boards released by Amrita School of Computing, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore.
It is an all in one kit to get you started on embedded systems development.

### The Board

The ASC CSE IoT 2.0 comes with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. It is based on the Espressif ESP32-WROOM Series.
It can be connected to a PC via a USB Type - C connector for power, programming and serial communication.
The board also houses
- 2 Programmable LEDs
- 1 LDR
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 Programmable Switch

The board has custom made connectors for various commonly used sensors and modules:
- 3-Axis Gyroscope and AccelerometerMPU6050
- CAN Transceiver TJA105
- USB2UART FT232 Module
- 8 MB SPI based Data Flash module W25Q64

This enables simple plug-and-play use.

Other modules using the same protocols will need to be connected to these interfaces using jumper wires if their pinouts don't match the connectors on the board.


## Setup Arduino IDE

Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you haven't done so already.

1. Open the Arduino IDE. ![Open](assets/open.png)

4. Click OK.

The required libraries should start downloading automatically (you will be notified). If not, do this:
1. Click on Tools > Boards > Boards Manager...
2. Search for "esp32" . ![Boards](assets/boards.png)
3. Install "esp32 by Espressif Systems" ![Install](assets/install.png)
4. Verify that the installation starts. ![Done](assets/done.png)

Once the installation is complete, you can plug in your board to your PC and write code for it.

Head over to the `basics/led_blink` folder to get started with programming on the ASC CSE IoT 2.0.
