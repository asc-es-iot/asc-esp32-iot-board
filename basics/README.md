# Connecting your board to your PC

We assume that you have setup Arduino IDE. If not, please view the repository's [README](../README.md)

After connecting your board to your PC with a USB Type C cable, it should be automatically detected by your OS. If not, you will have to install the respective USB serial communication driver for you OS. A simple Google search will give you what you need.

We proceed assuming that your board is detected by your OS.

To connect your board to the Arduino IDE,

1. Click on "Select Board" > "Select other board and port...".
