# Simple LED Blink

## Introduction

The LED Blink program is equivalent to the traditional "Hello World!" program that most coders begin their jouney with.

In this program, we will make one of the onboard LEDs blink. You can choose either LED 1 or LED 2. It doesn't really make a difference. 
Note that the PIN numbers for the LEDs are as follows:
- LED1 - GPIO pin 33 
- LED2 - GPIO pin 4

Here, GPIO stands for "General Purpose Input Output". This means that the pin can be used for either output or input. We will have to specify this in our program.

## Equipments Required

| Name  | Specification | Quantity |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ASC CSE IoT 2.0 Board | - | 1 |
| USB Type C Cable | Data cable | 1 |
| Personal Computer | Arduino IDE Installed | 1 |

## Connections

No external connections to the board are required for this program. Just connect your board to your PC. Refer to [this](../README.md) if you are facing difficulties.

## Code Explanation 

<!-- To be added.  -->

## Conclusion

Yay! You've written your first program for embedded systems! If you're up for a challenge, try solving the problrms mentioned in **Extras**. When you're ready, head over to the [README](../button/README.md) for the onboard button to get started with handling inputs.

## Extras

You could modify the LED blink program to 
1. Make the two LEDs on the board blink in unison.
1. Make the two LEDs on the board blink alternately.
